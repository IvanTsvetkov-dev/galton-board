## About

What is Galton board?The Galton board is a box with a transparent front wall. Pins forming a triangle are driven into the back wall in a checkerboard pattern. Balls are thrown into the box through a funnel from above. 
Ideally, when colliding with a pin, the ball can turn either to the right or to the left every time with the same probability.With a large number of balls, we will see a normal distribution
